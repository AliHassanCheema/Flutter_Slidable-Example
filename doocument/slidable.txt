   A Slidable Widget in flutter is a widget that let us add actions on your list items when we are sliding it to the left or to the right.
   It is easy and simple to get started with the package.

   we will be able to perform actions on dismissing the tile by using the dismissible property of the widget.
   we will also be able to add multiple slide actions by using the SlidableAction property of the widget.
   We will have Option to disable the slide effect easily
   There are mainly four types of motion that we can give to the slide. Behind Motion, Drawer Motion, Scroll Motion, Stretch Motion.
